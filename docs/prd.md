# Product Requirements Document - go-plc

**Author:** Andy
**Date:** 2025-12-13

## Executive Summary

**go-plc** is a fast, simple soft PLC built in Go that enables automation engineers to develop and test PLC programs using modern software development tools and workflows. Designed for rapid iteration cycles, comprehensive industrial connectivity, and AI-assisted development - making PLC programming accessible to modern developers without requiring proprietary IDEs or vendor-specific languages.

**Primary Context:** Boot.dev capstone project with ~50 hours to MVP, built with community feedback and designed for real-world use beyond academic demonstration.

**Target Users:**
- **Primary:** Automation engineers frustrated with slow iteration cycles and proprietary tooling who want to use modern development workflows (Git, IDEs, CI/CD)
- **Secondary:** IoT/edge developers who know modern languages and need industrial protocol support without learning IEC 61131-3

### What Makes This Special

**The Key Insight:** Instead of asking "how do we make old tools work with new workflows," go-plc asks "what would a PLC look like if we designed it today with modern tools?"

**Core Differentiators:**

1. **Unapologetically modern** - Embraces a real programming language (Go) with all its tooling (Git, IDEs, testing frameworks, CI/CD) instead of trying to preserve or modernize legacy IEC 61131-3 languages

2. **Performance-first architecture** - Native Go compilation means predictable performance, real-time capability, and single binary deployment

3. **Built for modern developers** - If you know Go, you can program PLCs. No proprietary IDEs, no vendor-specific languages to learn

4. **Documentation as product** - Comprehensive Docusaurus site that makes industrial protocols and PLC concepts accessible to modern developers (not just industrial automation veterans)

5. **AI-native development** - Simple text-based configuration (YAML), code that AI models can actually read and generate (unlike vendor-specific graphical languages), potential MCP integration for AI-assisted development

6. **Open and vendor-neutral** - All standard protocols (Modbus, OPC UA, Sparkplug B, GraphQL), no proprietary lock-in, true portability across Linux/Windows

**Inspiration:** Inspired by James Joy's Tentacle PLC and the philosophy of abandoning IEC 61131-3 in favor of modern programming languages and tooling.

## Project Classification

**Technical Type:** IoT/Embedded (Industrial edge device with real-time control and industrial protocols)
**Domain:** General (Industrial automation without specialized regulatory requirements)
**Complexity:** Medium (Real-time requirements, multiple protocols, performance constraints)
**Project Context:** Greenfield - new project

This is an industrial IoT/edge application that must handle real-time control loop execution, multiple industrial communication protocols (Modbus TCP, OPC UA, Sparkplug B), and provide modern developer interfaces (GraphQL API, WebUI). Performance is critical with task execution overhead <50µs and API response times <10ms. The project prioritizes developer experience, comprehensive documentation, and AI-assisted development capabilities.

## Success Criteria

### User Success

**The "Worth It" Moment:**
Users know Go, read the documentation, and get their first PLC program running quickly. When they hit hurdles, comprehensive documentation and accessible community support (Discord/GitHub Issues) provide solutions. They accomplish their control tasks fast and easily without fighting the tool.

**Measurable User Success:**
- **Fast onboarding:** <30 minutes from "I want to test a control idea" to "I have it running" (first-time setup)
- **Rapid iteration:** <1 minute cycles for edit Go task → test on hardware
- **Familiar tooling:** Users leverage existing development tools (VS Code, Git, CI/CD) without proprietary IDEs
- **Protocol integration:** Automation engineers integrate industrial protocols (Modbus, OPC UA, Sparkplug B) without deep protocol expertise
- **Native language:** IoT/edge developers write PLC programs in Go rather than learning IEC 61131-3

**Emotional Success Moments:**
- **Relief:** "I don't need to learn another proprietary IDE"
- **Delight:** "It just compiled to a single binary and deployed"
- **Empowerment:** "I can version control my PLC code with Git!"

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: Marcus Chen - Breaking Free from Vendor Lock-in
**User Type: Automation Engineer**

Marcus is a controls engineer at an upstream oil & gas company who's been programming Allen-Bradley PLCs for 15 years. He's tired of waiting 20 minutes just to compile and download a simple logic change to test a new pump sequencing idea. When his manager assigns him a new site coming online - a central tank battery that needs full automation - Marcus sees an opportunity to try something different.

Late one Friday, frustrated after another slow iteration cycle on a different project, he discovers go-plc on GitHub. The promise of "sub-minute iteration cycles" and "version control your PLC code with Git" catches his attention. He decides to spend his weekend trying something new.

Saturday morning, Marcus installs Go and go-plc following the Docusaurus docs. Within 25 minutes, he has a simple control task running - reading Modbus values from a Python simulator and controlling a virtual pump. He's shocked. He makes a logic change, rebuilds, and sees it running 45 seconds later. No proprietary IDE. No licensing dongles. Just his favorite VS Code editor and a terminal.

The breakthrough comes when he implements the tank battery logic in Go. The code is clear, version-controlled in Git, and he can iterate on control strategies in minutes instead of hours. When he connects Ignition SCADA via Sparkplug B and sees real-time data flowing, he realizes he's found what he's been looking for. Two weeks later, the new site comes online with go-plc running the tank battery, and Marcus has a modern, maintainable control system that he can troubleshoot and update from anywhere with Git access.

**This journey reveals requirements for:**
- Clear installation and quickstart documentation
- Go task development with simple variable access API
- Modbus I/O integration with simulator support for testing
- SCADA integration via Sparkplug B and OPC UA
- Fast build and deployment workflow (<1 minute iteration)
- Git-friendly project structure (text-based configuration)
- Tank battery reference implementation as example

### Journey 2: Sarah Rodriguez - Bridging the IT/OT Gap
**User Type: IoT/Edge Developer**

Sarah is a software developer at a tech startup building an edge analytics platform for industrial sites. She knows Python, Go, and modern web technologies, but when her product manager says they need to pull data from customer PLCs via Modbus and OPC UA, she panics. She's never touched industrial protocols and the thought of learning Ladder Logic to understand customer systems is overwhelming.

Her team considers buying expensive industrial gateway hardware, but the $5,000 per-site cost doesn't fit their startup budget. Then she finds go-plc while searching for "open source Modbus OPC UA golang." The documentation promises "industrial protocol support without deep protocol expertise."

She follows the quickstart guide and within 30 minutes has go-plc reading Modbus data from a test simulator. The Go code makes sense - it's just like any other Go application she's built. She configures a few YAML files for variables and scaling, writes a simple Go task to process the data, and suddenly she has industrial data flowing into her analytics platform via the GraphQL API.

The real win comes when a customer asks if they can integrate via OPC UA instead of the REST API. Sarah checks the go-plc docs, adds three lines to the YAML config, and OPC UA is enabled. No custom driver development. No vendor support contracts. Just configuration. Her CTO is impressed that she bridged the IT/OT gap in a weekend using familiar tools.

**This journey reveals requirements for:**
- GraphQL API for modern web/app integration
- YAML configuration documentation for non-PLC developers
- Multiple integration options (GraphQL, OPC UA, Sparkplug B)
- Industrial protocol abstraction (no deep Modbus/OPC UA expertise needed)
- Clear API documentation and examples
- Quick integration path for developers familiar with Go

### Journey 3: Jake Morrison - Night Shift Problem Solver
**User Type: Operations/Maintenance Personnel**

Jake is an operations technician working night shifts at a remote tank battery site. He's not a programmer, but he's responsible for keeping the automation running and responding when alarms go off. When the old PLC system had issues, he'd have to call Marcus (the controls engineer) at 2 AM and wait hours for remote troubleshooting.

With go-plc deployed at his site, Jake's life changes. One night, he notices tank levels aren't updating in SCADA. Instead of immediately calling for help, he opens the go-plc WebUI on his tablet. He can see that the Modbus connection to the remote I/O is disconnected - the status shows red with "Connection failed: timeout."

He checks the physical I/O rack, notices a loose network cable, reconnects it, and watches the WebUI status turn green within seconds. The tank levels start updating again. The configurable logging helped him see exactly what failed without needing to interpret cryptic PLC error codes.

Jake sends Marcus a quick text: "Fixed the Modbus issue - loose cable. WebUI made it obvious. Back to normal." Marcus, still asleep, sees it in the morning and smiles. The system's transparency and clear status monitoring just saved both of them a middle-of-the-night troubleshooting session.

**This journey reveals requirements for:**
- WebUI with real-time connection status monitoring
- Clear error messages (no cryptic codes)
- Visual health indicators (connection state: green/red)
- Mobile-friendly WebUI (tablet access)
- Configurable logging with human-readable output
- System diagnostics accessible to non-programmers

### Journey 4: David Park - Fast Commissioning Under Pressure
**User Type: System Integrator**

David runs a small controls integration company that gets called when oil & gas operators need automation systems commissioned quickly. He's just landed a contract to integrate three new tank battery sites with the client's existing Ignition SCADA system. The deadline is tight - 6 weeks for all three sites.

The client mentions their controls engineer (Marcus) has been piloting go-plc and wants David to deploy it across all three sites. David is skeptical - he's used to traditional PLCs and knows their quirks. But the timeline is aggressive, so he agrees to try.

David downloads go-plc and reads through the Docusaurus deployment guide. He's pleasantly surprised - there's a complete section on Linux device configuration for real-time performance, SCADA integration examples, and even a tank battery reference implementation that matches exactly what he needs to deploy.

At the first site, he installs go-plc on an industrial Linux edge device, copies the tank battery configuration YAML, adjusts the Modbus addresses for the local I/O, and starts the service. Within 2 hours, the PLC is running. He configures the Sparkplug B settings to point to the client's MQTT broker, and data starts flowing into Ignition immediately.

The breakthrough moment comes when the client requests a logic change during commissioning. David opens the Go task file, makes the adjustment, rebuilds the binary, and restarts the service. Total time: 3 minutes. With a traditional PLC, this would have meant opening a proprietary IDE, connecting remotely, downloading the program, and testing - easily 30 minutes.

By week 4, all three sites are commissioned and running. David finishes two weeks early and realizes go-plc just changed his business model. He can bid more competitively and deliver faster than competitors still using traditional PLCs.

**This journey reveals requirements for:**
- Linux deployment documentation (installation, configuration, service setup)
- Real-time performance tuning guide for Linux
- SCADA integration configuration examples (Sparkplug B, OPC UA)
- Reusable configuration templates (tank battery example)
- Single binary deployment (no complex dependencies)
- Fast rebuild and restart workflow for field changes
- Production-ready reliability and error handling

### Journey 5: Andy - Proving Modern PLC Development
**User Type: Developer/Creator (Capstone Context)**

Andy is completing his Boot.dev capstone project and wants to build something that demonstrates real-world engineering skills - not just another CRUD app that sits in a GitHub repo collecting dust. He's worked in industrial automation and knows the pain points: slow iteration, proprietary tools, vendor lock-in. He decides to build go-plc to prove there's a better way.

He has an existing CompactLogix tank battery program from a previous project - real production code with tank level monitoring, pump sequencing, and alarm logic. This becomes his validation case: if he can recreate this in go-plc and it's actually better, the project succeeds.

Andy starts by researching existing Go libraries to accelerate development. He finds `simonvetter/modbus` for Modbus TCP, `gopcua/opcua` for OPC UA server capabilities, and `eclipse-paho/paho.mqtt.golang` as the foundation for Sparkplug B (which he'll extend with Sparkplug B protobuf encoding and message patterns). Standing on the shoulders of these existing libraries means he can focus on the core PLC runtime architecture and Sparkplug B implementation rather than reinventing low-level protocol handling.

He builds the project structure, integrating these libraries into a cohesive runtime. The YAML configuration system comes next - he wants users to define variables once and have them auto-expose to all protocols (Modbus, OPC UA, Sparkplug B, GraphQL).

The critical moment comes when he uses AI to analyze his CompactLogix program and help translate the logic into Go tasks. The AI understands the control patterns and generates clean Go code. Andy refines it, adds proper error handling, and implements the tank battery logic. When he runs it for the first time and sees the same control behavior as the CompactLogix version - but with faster iteration cycles and readable code - he knows he's onto something.

He spends significant time on documentation, creating a comprehensive Docusaurus site. He wants someone like Marcus (the automation engineer from Journey 1) to be able to adopt go-plc without Andy having to personally onboard them. Installation guides, configuration examples, the tank battery walkthrough, performance benchmarks - all documented thoroughly.

When Andy deploys the final system, integrates it with Ignition SCADA via both OPC UA and Sparkplug B, and validates the performance metrics (<50µs task execution, <10ms API response), he has his answer to the ultimate question: "Would I use this in a real control project?"

Yes. Absolutely yes.

He submits his capstone with confidence - not just because it demonstrates Go skills, concurrency, real-time systems, and protocol integration - but because he's built something he'd actually recommend to other engineers.

**This journey reveals requirements for:**
- Integration with existing Go libraries (simonvetter/modbus, gopcua/opcua, paho.mqtt.golang)
- Sparkplug B protocol implementation (protobuf encoding, NBIRTH/NDATA/NDEATH messages)
- YAML configuration system with single-definition principle
- AI-friendly code structure for migration assistance

## Innovation & Novel Patterns

### Detected Innovation Areas

**Core Innovation: Complete Rejection of IEC 61131-3**

go-plc follows the groundbreaking philosophy pioneered by James Joy's Tentacle PLC: industrial automation doesn't need proprietary IEC 61131-3 languages (Ladder Logic, Structured Text, FBD). Modern programming languages are superior for PLC development.

**go-plc's Contribution:**

Building on Tentacle's proven approach of using modern languages, go-plc explores whether native compiled Go can deliver even better performance and simplicity compared to interpreted languages. The goal is simple and fast PLC development using tools modern developers already know.

**Key Innovative Aspects:**

1. **Native Compiled Approach** - Pure Go compilation (no runtime engine overhead) for predictable performance, real-time capability, and single binary deployment

2. **YAML Single-Definition Principle** - Define variables once in YAML, automatically expose to all protocols (Modbus, OPC UA, Sparkplug B, GraphQL) - eliminating duplicate definitions across systems

3. **AI-Assisted Migration** - Leveraging AI to analyze existing PLC programs (CompactLogix, etc.) and translate logic into clean Go code, making migration from proprietary systems accessible

4. **Comprehensive Protocol Integration** - All industrial protocols in one platform (Modbus TCP, OPC UA, Sparkplug B, GraphQL) without vendor lock-in or complex gateway hardware

5. **Developer Experience as Product** - Git version control, modern IDEs, CI/CD pipelines, and comprehensive documentation make industrial automation accessible to the broader software development community

### Market Context & Competitive Landscape

**Existing Approaches:**

- **Traditional PLCs (Allen-Bradley, Siemens, etc.):** Proprietary IEC 61131-3 implementations with slow iteration cycles, expensive IDEs, vendor lock-in
- **Tentacle PLC:** Pioneered modern language approach using JavaScript, proving the concept works in production
- **go-plc Position:** Evolution of Tentacle's philosophy using native Go for optimal performance and simplicity

**Target Gap:**

The industry has been trying to "modernize" IEC 61131-3 by adding Git integration or web IDEs to legacy languages. This approach is backwards. go-plc (following Tentacle's lead) asks: "What if we just used modern languages designed for concurrent, real-time systems?"

**Differentiation:**

Not competing with Tentacle PLC - building on its proven philosophy with a different implementation approach (compiled Go vs. JavaScript) optimized for performance-critical applications and Boot.dev capstone demonstration of advanced Go skills.

### Validation Approach

**Primary Validation: CompactLogix Tank Battery Migration**

The innovation will be validated through a real-world test case:

1. **Existing Production Logic:** Tank battery control program from CompactLogix (tank level monitoring, pump sequencing, alarm logic)
2. **AI-Assisted Translation:** Use AI to analyze Rockwell logic and generate equivalent Go code
3. **Functional Equivalence:** go-plc implementation must control tank battery identically to CompactLogix version
4. **Performance Validation:** Achieve <50µs task execution overhead and <10ms API response times
5. **Integration Validation:** Successfully integrate with Ignition SCADA via both OPC UA and Sparkplug B

**Success Criteria:**

Answer the question: "Would I actually use this in a real control project?"

If go-plc can replace CompactLogix for a production tank battery with:
- Faster iteration cycles (<1 minute vs. 20+ minutes)
- Clearer, more maintainable code
- Modern development workflow (Git, VS Code, CI/CD)
- Equivalent or better performance

Then the innovation succeeds.

**Validation Tools:**

- Python Modbus simulator for hardware-independent testing
- Ignition SCADA for protocol integration validation
- Performance benchmarking framework for objective measurement
- CompactLogix program as reference implementation

### Risk Mitigation

**Innovation Risk: Automation Engineer Adoption**

**Risk:** Automation engineers may resist learning Go instead of familiar IEC 61131-3 languages.

**Mitigation:**
- **Philosophy from Tentacle PLC:** Engineers already learn vendor-specific IEC 61131-3 implementations - might as well learn a real, transferable language
- **Documentation as Product:** Comprehensive Docusaurus site bridges knowledge gap for automation engineers new to Go
- **Target IoT Developers First:** Secondary user group (IoT/edge developers) already knows modern languages and needs industrial protocol support
- **Reference Implementation:** Tank battery example demonstrates complete real-world application
- **AI-Assisted Migration:** Lowers barrier to migrating existing PLC programs

**Innovation Risk: Performance Requirements**

**Risk:** Compiled Go might not meet <50µs task execution overhead target.

**Mitigation:**
- **Early Benchmarking:** Performance validation framework in MVP
- **Proven Technology:** Go designed for concurrent, real-time systems
- **Fallback:** If performance insufficient, document findings and scope lessons learned for capstone

**Innovation Risk: Protocol Complexity**

**Risk:** Implementing OPC UA, Sparkplug B, Modbus, GraphQL might exceed 50-hour timeline.

**Mitigation:**
- **Leverage Existing Libraries:** simonvetter/modbus, gopcua/opcua, paho.mqtt.golang
- **Incremental Protocol Support:** Start with Modbus + one SCADA protocol (Sparkplug B or OPC UA), add second if time permits
- **Clear MVP Scope:** Working tank battery with minimum viable protocol integration proves concept

**The Ultimate Fallback:**

Even if adoption is limited, the capstone demonstrates:
- Advanced Go skills (concurrency, protocols, real-time systems)
- Real-world engineering problem-solving
- Comprehensive documentation and testing
- Something the developer would actually use

## IoT/Embedded Specific Requirements

### Deployment & Update Mechanisms

**MVP Deployment Model:**

Manual deployment process following standard DevOps best practices:

**Deployment Process:**
1. Build single binary for target platform (Linux/Windows)
2. Transfer binary to edge device (scp, sftp, or deployment tool)
3. Stop existing service (if running)
4. Replace binary
5. Start service with configuration file
6. Verify connectivity and operation via WebUI

**Configuration Management:**
- YAML configuration files managed separately from binary
- Version control for configuration (Git recommended)
- Configuration validation on startup with clear error messages

### Implementation Considerations

**Single Binary Deployment:**
- Go compilation produces single executable
- WebUI assets embedded using Go embed package
- No external dependencies beyond standard Linux libraries
- Cross-compilation for Linux and Windows targets

**Concurrent Architecture:**
- Goroutines for I/O sources (Modbus polling loops)
- Goroutines for task execution (scheduled per task scan rate)
- Goroutines for protocol servers (OPC UA, GraphQL, WebUI)
- Channel-based communication between components

**Graceful Shutdown:**
- Signal handling for SIGTERM/SIGINT
- Coordinated shutdown of all goroutines
- Flush logs and close connections cleanly
- No data corruption on normal shutdown

**Logging & Diagnostics:**
- Configurable logging levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- Structured logging for machine parsing
- Human-readable error messages for operators
- Log rotation and retention policies (documented)

**Resource Management:**
- In-memory variable storage (no persistence in MVP)
- Memory-efficient protocol buffers for Sparkplug B
- Connection pooling and resource cleanup
- Memory leak detection in testing
